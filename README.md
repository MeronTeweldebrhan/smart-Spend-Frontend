##  My Process

###  Built With
- Java script
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js & Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- bcrypt
- cors
- Netlify & Render for deployment
- Chart libraries: `recharts`
- State management via React Context API
---

###  What I Learned
- **Table-wise displaying**: Handling large sets of transaction/category data efficiently with dynamic rendering.
- **Debouncing**: Reduced unnecessary API calls while typing (search, filters, etc.).
- **Batch Posting**: Implemented functionality to submit multiple transactions at once.
- **CORS issues**: Understood and resolved cross-origin errors in Express with custom origin handling.
- **Bar chart visualizations**: Successfully implemented charting (after previous failed attempts in other projects) using `recharts`.
- **JavaScript debugging**: Improved use of browser dev tools and `console.log()` for identifying runtime issues and async flow.
- **Modular backend design**: Created clean route/controller structure for scalability and easier maintenance.
- **Global Window Object**: Learned how to access various properties and methods globally using the window object.

### Continued Development
Next steps I'm planning to implement:
- **Team collaboration**:
  - Invite collaborators with different privileges , admin, viewer.
  - Admin account creator can assign roles and manage access.
- **Import from Excel/PDF**:
   - uploadeing batch datas form bank or credit statements pdf/excel that makea easier and save time.
  - **Implement proper erorr handling** :
  - using inline valdation or using toast dependecies
  - currently am using alert erorr handling messages to have basic user expernices
  - implment Pagination and other styles for better data managment.
