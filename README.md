## 🚀 My Process

### 🔧 Built With
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js & Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- Netlify & Render (for deployment)
- Chart libraries: `recharts`
- State management via React Context API

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- **Table-wise displaying**: Handling large sets of transaction/category data efficiently with dynamic rendering.
- **Debouncing**: Reduced unnecessary API calls while typing (search, filters, etc.).
- **Batch Posting**: Implemented functionality to submit multiple transactions at once.
- **CORS issues**: Understood and resolved cross-origin errors in Express with custom origin handling.
- **Bar chart visualizations**: Successfully implemented charting (after previous failed attempts in other projects) using `recharts`.
- **JavaScript debugging**: Improved use of browser dev tools and `console.log()` for identifying runtime issues and async flow.
- **Modular backend design**: Created clean route/controller structure for scalability and easier maintenance.

---

### 🔭 Continued Development
Next steps I'm planning to implement:
- **Team collaboration**:
  - Invite collaborators with different privileges (e.g., admin, viewer).
  - Admin (account creator) can assign roles and manage access.
- **Import from Excel/PDF**:
  - Automatically create transactions and categories from uploaded files.
